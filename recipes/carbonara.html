<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Indulge in the rich and satisfying flavors of Spaghetti alla Carbonara. This iconic Italian pasta dish features al dente spaghetti coated in a velvety sauce made from eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, crispy pancetta or bacon, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Spaghetti</li>
    <li>Guanciale or bacon</li>
    <li>Egg yolk</li>
    <li>Pecorino cheese</li>
    <li>Freshly gound black pepper</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p><strong>Cook the spaghetti</strong></p>
        <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente according to the package instructions. Drain the pasta, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta water.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Cook the Guanciale</strong></p>
        <p>In a skillet or frying pan, cook the diced Guanciale over medium heat until crispy and golden brown. Remove from heat and set aside.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Prepare the sauce</strong></p>
        <p>In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, grated Pecorino cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Combine the pasta and guanciale</strong></p>
        <p>Return the drained spaghetti to the pot or a large serving bowl. Add the cooked Guanciale and toss to combine.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Add the sauce</strong></p>
        <p>While the spaghetti is still hot, pour the egg yolk and Pecorino cheese mixture over the pasta. Toss quickly and thoroughly to coat the spaghetti evenly. The heat from the pasta will lightly cook the egg yolks, creating a creamy and flavorful sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, gradually add some of the reserved pasta water to achieve the desired consistency.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Serve</strong></p></li>
        <p>Divide the spaghetti alla Carbonara among individual serving plates or bowls. Sprinkle with additional freshly ground black pepper and grated Pecorino cheese if desired.</p>
    <li><p><strong>Enjoy immediately</strong></p></li>
        <p>Spaghetti alla Carbonara is best enjoyed right away while it's still hot. Serve as a main course or with a side salad and crusty bread for a complete meal.
