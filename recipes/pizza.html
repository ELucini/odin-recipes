<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Pizza dough</li>
    <li>San Marzano tomatoes</li>
    <li>Fior di latte from Agerola</li>
    <li>Fresh Basil</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p><strong>Preheat the oven</strong></p>
        <p>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible, usually around 500°F (260°C). This ensures a crispy crust.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Shape the dough</strong></p>
        <p>Using your hands or a rolling pin, stretch and shape the dough into a round or rectangular shape, depending on your preference. Aim for a thin crust, but be careful not to make it too thin to prevent tearing.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Add the tomato sauce</strong></p>
        <p>Spread a thin, even layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust. Use the back of a spoon or a ladle to help spread the sauce.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Add Fior di Latte from Agerola</strong></p>
        <p>Tear or slice the Fior di Latte from Agerola, a delicious fresh cheese, into small pieces and distribute them evenly over the tomato sauce. Make sure the cheese covers most of the pizza.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Drizzle with olive oil</strong></p>
        <p>Lightly drizzle some extra-virgin olive oil over the pizza. This adds flavor and helps the ingredients brown nicely.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Bake the pizza</strong></p></li>
        <p>Carefully transfer the baking sheet or pizza stone with the pizza into the preheated oven. Bake for approximately 10-15 minutes or until the crust turns golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</p>
    <li><p><strong>Serve and enjoy!</strong></p></li>
        <p>Once the pizza is done baking, remove it from the oven, add the fresh basil and let it cool for a few minutes. Slice it into desired portions and serve hot. Enjoy your delicious homemade Pizza Margherita!
